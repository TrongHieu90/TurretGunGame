## There is a scene file in Sample Scene folder. Simply copy the asset folder and run the scene file inside unity to run the prototype game.

**Game Design:** the prototype is built with a turret controller to use mouse movement to rotate the turrets. There are different guns to choose from and player will get scores by destroying enemy

**Game features:** Some simple design patterns that are open to be expanded (turret controller scheme, mechanics to add new guns, etc.)
